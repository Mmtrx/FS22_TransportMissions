# FS22_TransportMissions
Mod to generate transport missions on the standard maps

If you missed the simple transport missions from earlier game versions, you should try this mod. It generates transport missions that can be chosen in the "Contracts" menu, in addition to the fieldwork jobs.

Only for the standard Elmcreek map yet. If you'd like to help enhancing this for the Alpine and French maps, please get in touch.
